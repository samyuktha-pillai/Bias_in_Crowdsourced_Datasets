# Bias_in_Crowdsourced_Datasets

## 📌 Overview
This project investigates potential biases present in a crowdsourced dataset.  
The analysis is performed in the Jupyter Notebook **`biasInCrowdsourcedDataset_v2.ipynb`**, which explores patterns, distributions, and potential fairness concerns in the collected data.

The goal is to understand:
- Whether certain groups are over- or under-represented  
- How labeling discrepancies occur  
- What patterns might indicate bias  
- Statistical summaries and visualizations reflecting these findings
